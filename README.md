# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. It allows two players to take turns and play the game until there is a winner or a tie.

## How to Play

1. The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid, where each cell can be empty ("-"), marked by player "X", or marked by player "O".

2. Players take turns entering their moves by choosing a number between 1 and 9 corresponding to the cell they want to mark.

3. The game checks for a win condition after each move. A player wins if they have three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

4. The game ends in a tie if there are no empty cells left and no player has won.

5. After each move, the game board is displayed, showing the current positions of the marks.

## Getting Started

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (version 3.x recommended).
2. Clone or download the game code from the repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the game code is located.
